This repository contains a subset of exercises from Samvera Camp that will be used during the [Dive into Hyrax](https://sc2019.sched.com/event/R67s/dive-into-hyrax) and [Test Driven Hyrax Development](https://sc2019.sched.com/event/R68G/test-driven-hyrax-development) workshops at [Samvera Connect 2019](https://connect2019.samvera.org)

The goal of these workshsops is to introduce new developers to some of the skills and tools you will need to successfully build Hyrax-based digital repository solutions.  There’s a lot of ground to cover and we won't be able to cover everything you'll need, but we hope we’ll have provided you enough of a scaffolding to jump-start your own work and keep learning like the rest of us.  

We encourage participation from throughout the library and open source communities. In order to ensure that everyone can enjoy a safe, welcoming, and respectful environment, please familiarize yourself with the [Samvera Community Code of Conduct](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Code+of+Conduct) and [Anti-Harassment Policy](https://wiki.duraspace.org/display/samvera/Anti-Harassment+Policy)
